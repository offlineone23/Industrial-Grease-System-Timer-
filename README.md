Industrial Grease Lubrication Timer – Embedded C

Overview:
Designed and implemented an embedded timer system for industrial grease lubrication, controlling 28 independent motors along production lines in Rolling Mill 300, Esfahan Steel Company. The system stabilizes power fluctuations using recycled computer power supplies, minimizes industrial noise, and ensures reliable operation in harsh industrial environments.

Key Features:

Control of 28 three-phase grease delivery motors

Configurable start times from 10 minutes up to 48 hours via 16x2 character LCD

Simple user interface with only 3 buttons for full configuration

High timing accuracy and efficiency compared to legacy analog systems

Easy debugging and modifications using Proteus simulation for AVR

Cost-effective design implemented before PLC-based panels

Technical Highlights:

Embedded C programming on AVR microcontroller

Isolated relay circuits to protect MCU from industrial noise

Reliable pre-PLC automation solution with minimal cost and high performance

Impact:

Improved operational efficiency and energy savings

Significant reduction in grease consumption

User-friendly system operable by personnel with minimal technical experience
